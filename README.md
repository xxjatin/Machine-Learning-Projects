Flight Price Prediction Project
📖 Overview
The Flight Price Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the prices of flights based on various features. By analyzing historical flight data, this project seeks to provide travelers with insights into pricing trends and help them make informed decisions when booking flights.

🎯 Objectives
To develop an accurate predictive model for flight prices.
To analyze factors affecting flight prices, such as time of booking, airline, and travel duration.
To provide a user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the model.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python

Libraries:
Pandas (data manipulation)
Scikit-learn (machine learning)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (data visualization)

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git

📊 Data
The dataset used for this project includes:

Flight prices
Departure and arrival airports
Airlines
Flight duration
Date of booking
Data was collected from Kaggle

🛠️ Implementation Steps
Data Collection: Gathered data from various sources.
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data to uncover trends and relationships.
Feature Engineering: Created new features to improve model performance.
Model Selection: Tested various algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) to find the best fit.
Model Evaluation: Used metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to assess model performance.


📈 Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of 90 on the test set, significantly reducing prediction error compared to baseline models. Visualizations indicate key factors influencing flight prices.

🚀 Future Work
Enhance the model with additional data sources (e.g., seasonal trends, economic factors).
Develop a web application to allow users to interact with the model.
Implement real-time data updates for more accurate predictions.
